 non-exclusive license, subject to third party intellectual property
 claims:
 .
 (a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
 Licensable by Initial Developer to use, reproduce, modify, display,

 to Modifications.
 3.0 DISTRIBUTION OBLIGATIONS
 .
 3.1 Application of License.
 The Source Code version of Original Code may be distributed only under
 the terms of this License or a future version of this License released
 under Section 6.1, and You must include a copy of this License with
 every copy of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or
 impose any terms on any Source Code version that alters or restricts
 the applicable version of this License or the recipients' rights
 hereunder. Your license for shipment of the Contributor Version is
 conditioned upon Your full compliance with this Section. The
 Modifications which You create must comply with all requirements set
 out by the Standards body in effect one hundred twenty (120) days
 before You ship the Contributor Version. In the event that the
 Modifications do not meet such requirements, You agree to publish
 either (i) any deviation from the Standards protocol resulting from
 implementation of Your Modifications and a reference implementation of
 Your Modifications or (ii) Your Modifications in Source Code form, and
 to make any such deviation and reference implementation or
 Modifications available to all third parties under the same terms as
 this license on a royalty free basis within thirty (30) days of Your
 first customer shipment of Your Modifications.
 .
 3.2 Required Notices.
 You must duplicate the notice in Exhibit A in each file of the Source
 Code. If it is not possible to put such notice in a particular Source
 Code file due to its structure, then You must include such notice in a
 location (such as a relevant directory) where a user would be likely to
 look for such a notice. If You created one or more Modification(s) You
 may add Your name as a Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit
 A. You must also duplicate this License in any documentation for the
 Source Code where You describe recipients' rights or ownership rights
 relating to Initial Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee
 for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligations to one or
 more recipients of Your version of the Code. However, You may do so
 only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer.
 You must make it absolutely clear than any such warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
 hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer for any liability
 incurred by the Initial Developer as a result of warranty, support,
 indemnity or liability terms You offer.
 .
 3.3 Distribution of Executable Versions.
 You may distribute Original Code in Executable and Source form only if
 the requirements of Sections 3.1 and 3.2 have been met for that
 Original Code, and if You include a notice stating that the Source Code
 version of the Original Code is available under the terms of this
 License. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
 Executable or Source versions, related documentation or collateral in
 which You describe recipients' rights relating to the Original Code.
 You may distribute the Executable and Source versions of Your version
 of the Code or ownership rights under a license of Your choice, which
 may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
 compliance with the terms of this License. If You distribute the
 Executable and Source versions under a different license You must make
 it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from this License are
 offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer. You hereby agree to
 indemnify the Initial Developer for any liability incurred by the
 Initial Developer as a result of any such terms You offer.
 .
 3.4 Larger Works.
 You may create a Larger Work by combining Original Code with other code
 not governed by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
 Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make sure the
 requirements of this License are fulfilled for the Original Code.
 .
 4.0 INABILITY TO COMPLY DUE TO STATUTE OR REGULATION
 .
 If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
 License with respect to some or all of the Original Code due to
 statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
 the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
 describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description
 must be included in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.2 and must be
 included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the
 extent prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
 sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
 understand it.
 .
 5.0 APPLICATION OF THIS LICENSE
 .
 This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
 attached the notice in Exhibit A and to related Modifications as set
 out in Section 3.1.
 .
 6.0 VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE
 .
 6.1 New Versions.
 Sun may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to
 time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
 .
 6.2 Effect of New Versions.
 Once Original Code has been published under a particular version of the
 License, You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
 version. You may also choose to use such Original Code under the terms
 of any subsequent version of the License published by Sun. No one other
 than Sun has the right to modify the terms applicable to Original Code.
 .
 7.0 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
 .
 ORIGINAL CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
 WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
 WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE ORIGINAL CODE IS FREE OF
 DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING.
 THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE ORIGINAL CODE
 IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY ORIGINAL CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT,
 YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY
 SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
 CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY ORIGINAL
 CODE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.
 .
 8.0 TERMINATION
 .
 8.1 This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
 automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
 such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
 sublicenses to the Original Code which are properly granted shall
 survive any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their
 nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License
 shall survive.
 .
 8.2 In the event of termination under Section 8.1 above, all end user
 license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have
 been validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to
 termination shall survive termination.
 .
 9.0 LIMIT OF LIABILITY
 .
 UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
 (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL
 DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF ORIGINAL CODE,
 OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY
 INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
 CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
 WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
 COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
 INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF
 LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY
 RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
 PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
 EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
 EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .

 matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
