      Convention for heading levels in Open vSwitch documentation:

      =======  Heading 0 (reserved for the title in a document)
      -------  Heading 1
      ~~~~~~~  Heading 2
      +++++++  Heading 3
      '''''''  Heading 4

      Avoid deeper levels because they do not render well.


========================
Open vSwitch with MEMIF
========================

This document describes how to build and install Open vSwitch using
MEMIF netdev.

.. warning::
  The MEMIF support of Open vSwitch is considered 'experimental',
  and it is not compiled in by default.


Introduction
------------
MEMIF is an interface for container networking,
see [1,2] for introduction and [3] for build.

[3] https://docs.fd.io/vpp/17.10/libmemif_build_doc.html


Installing
----------
For OVS to use memif netdev, it has to be configured with libmemif support.
First, clone a recent version of VPP tree::

  git clone https://gerrit.fd.io/r/vpp

Second, go into the vpp source directory::

  cd vpp/extras/libmemif/
  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make

.. note::
   Make sure lib/libmemif.h is installed in system's library path,
   e.g. /usr/local/include/ or /usr/include/.
   And make sure build/lib/libmemif.so is copied to shared lib path.

Make sure the libmemif.so is installed correctly::

  ldconfig
  ldconfig -p | grep libmemif

Third, ensure the standard OVS requirements are installed and
bootstrap/configure the package::

  ./boot.sh && ./configure --enable-memif

Finally, build and install OVS::

  make && make install


Setup MEMIF netdev
-------------------
Open vSwitch should be started using userspace datapath as described
in :doc:`general`::

  ovs-vswitchd ...
  ovs-vsctl -- add-br br0 -- set Bridge br0 datapath_type=netdev
  ovs-vsctl add-port br0 memif0 -- set int memif0 type=memif
  ovs-vsctl add-port br0 memif1 -- set int memif1 type=memif

OVS memif0 and memif1 runs as master mode, install OpenFlow rules::

  ovs-ofctl add-flow br0 "in_port=memif0 actions=output:memif1"
  ovs-ofctl add-flow br0 "in_port=memif1 actions=drop"

To send packets to memif ports, I use the example program from vpp::

  cd extras/libmemif/build/examples
  ./icmp_responder-epoll
  LIBMEMIF EXAMPLE APP: ICMP_Responder (debug)
  ==============================
  libmemif version: 3.0

Connect to memif0 (slave) and memif1 (slave) and send 1000
packets to memif0::

  conn 0 0 0
  conn 1 0 0
  send 0 1000 192.168.1.100 aa:bb:ff:ee:11:22

Check the stats at OVS by doing::

  ovs-ofctl dump-flows br0
  <skip> table=0, n_packets=1000, n_bytes=42000, in_port=memif0 \
    actions=output:memif1
  <skip> table=0, n_packets=1000, n_bytes=1024000, in_port=memif1 actions=drop
