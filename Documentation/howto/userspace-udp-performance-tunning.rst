      Convention for heading levels in Open vSwitch documentation:

      =======  Heading 0 (reserved for the title in a document)
      -------  Heading 1
      ~~~~~~~  Heading 2
      +++++++  Heading 3
      '''''''  Heading 4

      Avoid deeper levels because they do not render well.

Userspace UDP performance tunning
=================================

This document describes how to tune UDP performance for Open vSwitch
userspace. In Open vSwitch userspace case, if you run iperf3 to test UDP
performance, you will see bigger packet loss rate, sometimes, you also
will see iperf3 outputs some information as below.

or

iperf3: OUT OF ORDER - incoming packet = 70 and received packet = 97 AND SP = 5
iperf3: OUT OF ORDER - incoming packet = 71 and received packet = 97 AND SP = 5
iperf3: OUT OF ORDER - incoming packet = 72 and received packet = 99 AND SP = 5
iperf3: OUT OF ORDER - incoming packet = 14 and received packet = 123 AND SP = 5
iperf3: OUT OF ORDER - incoming packet = 15 and received packet = 125 AND SP = 5
iperf3: OUT OF ORDER - incoming packet = 78 and received packet = 137 AND SP = 5
iperf3: OUT OF ORDER - incoming packet = 79 and received packet = 137 AND SP = 5
iperf3: OUT OF ORDER - incoming packet = 80 and received packet = 139 AND SP = 5
iperf3: OUT OF ORDER - incoming packet = 82 and received packet = 172 AND SP = 5
iperf3: OUT OF ORDER - incoming packet = 83 and received packet = 173 AND SP = 5

There are many reasons resulting in such issues, for example, you don't use
-b to limit bandwidth, big packet(UDP packet data size is 8192 by default if
you don't use -l to specify UDP payload size) means many IP fragments if your
MTU is 1500/1450, any one of them is lost, that means the whole UDP packet
is lost because TCP/IP protocol stack can't reassemble original UDP packet, so
big packet isn't always good for performance. But among of them, the most
important reason is socket buffer size of UDP send side and receive side.

Here is iperf3 output if system interface added to OVS use default buffer size
(which is 212992 by default).

iperf Done.

You can see the performance number has huge improvement, packet loss rate
is 0.

.. note::

   This howto covers the steps required to tune UDP performance. The same
   approach can be used for iperf3 client and iperf3 server in VMs or network
   namespaces.

Tunning Steps
-------------

Perform the following steps on OVS node to tune socket buffer for OVS system
interface.

#. Change Linux system maximum socket buffer size for send and receive sides

       $ sudo sh -c "echo 1073741823 > /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max"
       $ sudo sh -c "echo 1073741823 > /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max"

   In order to ensure they are still set to the above value after your system
   is rebooted, you also need change systctl config to persist these values.

       $ sudo sh -c "echo net.core.rmem_max=1073741823 >> /etc/sysctl.conf"
       $ sudo sh -c "echo net.core.wmem_max=1073741823 >> /etc/sysctl.conf"

#. Change socket buffer size for OVS system interface

       $ sudo ovs-vsctl set Open_vSwitch . other_config:userspace-sock-buf-size=1073741823

   Note: other_config:userspace-sock-buf-size is both for receive socket buffer
   size and send socket buffer size, its possible value range is 212992 to
   1073741823, final receive socket buffer size for OVS system interface is two
   times minimum one of rmem_max and this value, final send socket buffer size
   for OVS system interface is two times minimum one of wmem_max and this value.
   So you can change it to the value you want just by changing
   other_config:userspace-sock-buf-size, you also can set
   other_config:userspace-sock-buf-size to 1073741823 then just change
   /proc/sys/net/core/rmem_max and /proc/sys/net/core/wmem_max to the value you
   want. The changed value will take effect only after restart ovs-vswitchd.

#. Restart ovs-vswitchd

   Note: you have to restart ovs-vswitchd to make sure the changed value takes
   effect.

#. You need repeat the above steps on all the OVS nodes to make sure
   cross-node veth-to-veth, veth-to-tap, or tap-to-tap UDP performance
   can get improved.

Potential Impact
----------------

Although this tunning can improve UDP performance, it possibly also
impacts on TCP performance, please reset the above values to default
values in your system if you see it hurts your TCP performance.
