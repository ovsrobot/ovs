Userspace Datapath - Conntrack Offloading
=========================================

This document describes the conntrack offloading infrastructure in the OVS
userspace datapath, explains the design rationale, and provides a step-by-step
guide for hardware vendors implementing a conntrack offload provider.

Overview
--------

Open vSwitch contains a userspace connection tracking (conntrack) engine
derived from the OpenBSD pf stack.  For every packet that carries a
``ct()`` action, OVS runs the packet through ``conntrack_execute()`` and
``process_one()``, which update connection state in software.

Modern hardware (SmartNICs, DPUs, and accelerator ASICs), often include a
native CT engine that can track connection state and report last-used
timestamps without involving the host CPU.  The conntrack offload framework
(``ct_offload_class``) provides the lifecycle event hooks that such hardware
needs to stay in sync with the OVS software CT table.

Architecture
------------

Conntrack offloading is deliberately kept separate from flow offloading
(``dpif_offload_class``).  The two layers serve different purposes:

* **Flow offloading** (``dpif_offload_class``): installs match/action rules
  in hardware: the equivalent of an ``rte_flow`` or TC flower rule.  After
  an upcall installs a datapath flow, the dpif-offload layer can push that
  rule to hardware so subsequent packets matching the same 5-tuple never
  cause a further upcall.

* **Conntrack offloading** (``ct_offload_class``): notifies hardware of
  connection lifecycle events:  new connections, bidirectional establishment,
  idle-timeout queries, and deletion.  Hardware uses these events to maintain
  its own CT state tables, which may be separate from the hardware flow table.

A real hardware provider will typically implement **both** interfaces: the
dpif-offload side to push forwarding rules, and the ct-offload side to program
hardware CT state.  The two interfaces share a common anchor: the
``struct netdev *`` passed in ``ct_offload_ctx.netdev_in`` identifies the
hardware port, and a provider can recover its ``dpif_offload`` instance from
``netdev->dpif_offload`` (as done in the DPDK and TC providers).

Software conntrack always runs for the first packets of a new connection.
Once the hardware has been programmed (via ``conn_add`` /
``conn_established``), the provider's dpif-offload side installs a hardware
flow rule that matches all subsequent packets for the connection before OVS's
software path, removing them from the upcall / conntrack loop entirely.  The
ct-offload callbacks then serve two ongoing roles: ``conn_update`` extends the
software expiry timer when hardware confirms the connection is still active,
and ``conn_del`` cleans up hardware state when OVS decides to retire the
connection.

Connection Lifecycle
--------------------

The following state machine shows when each callback fires and what the
provider is expected to do at each transition::

    packet arrives, ct(commit)
           |
           v
      [ conn_add ]  -- hardware: allocate CT entry, store conn* -> handle map
           |
           |  ... forward packets flow through hardware ...
           |
           v
    reply packet seen, CS_ESTABLISHED | CS_REPLY_DIR
           |
           v
    [ conn_established ] -- hardware: update CT entry with reply port;
           |                           return true to mark connection in HW
           |
           |  ... bidirectional traffic flows through hardware ...
           |
           |  OVS expiry timer fires
           |
           v
     [ conn_update ] -- hardware: return last-used timestamp (ms since epoch)
           |                      or 0 if connection unknown / expired in HW
           |
           |  if timestamp > current expiry: connection stays alive
           |
           v
    OVS decides to expire (or dpctl/flush-conntrack called)
           |
           v
      [ conn_del ]  -- hardware: look up conn* -> handle map, remove CT entry


``conn_established`` is called **exactly once** per connection: the first time
a reply-direction packet is seen while the connection is in the
``CT_OFFLOAD_STATE_ADDED`` state.  If ``conn_established`` returns ``true``,
OVS transitions the connection to ``CT_OFFLOAD_STATE_EST``.  If it returns
``false`` (the provider did not confirm hardware establishment), the state
remains ``CT_OFFLOAD_STATE_ADDED`` and ``conn_established`` will be called
again on the next eligible reply packet.

``conn_update`` is called periodically on offloaded connections while OVS's
idle timer is running.  A non-zero return value refreshes the software expiry,
keeping the connection alive as long as hardware reports activity.

The ``ct_offload_ctx`` Structure
---------------------------------

Every callback receives a ``const struct ct_offload_ctx *`` with the following
fields:

``conn``
    Pointer to the OVS connection object.  Stable for the lifetime of the
    connection (from ``conn_add`` through ``conn_del``).  Use this as the key
    in any internal ``conn* -> hardware_handle`` map.

``netdev_in``
    The input ``struct netdev *`` for the packet that triggered this event.
    Non-NULL at ``conn_add`` (forward-direction input port) and at
    ``conn_established`` (reply-direction input port).  **NULL at ``conn_del``
    and ``conn_update``** - the provider must look up its hardware state by
    ``conn`` instead.

``input_port_id``
    ODP port number corresponding to ``netdev_in``.  Provided for convenience;
    the same information can be derived from ``netdev_in``.

The ``ct_offload_class`` Interface
------------------------------------

Mandatory callbacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``can_offload(ctx)``
    Called before ``conn_add`` to determine whether this provider will handle
    the connection.  Return ``true`` to accept the connection; return ``false``
    to decline (the connection will not be added to this provider).  A minimal
    implementation can simply return ``true`` for all connections.

``conn_add(ctx)``
    Called when a new connection is committed (``ct(commit)``).
    ``ctx->netdev_in`` identifies the forward-direction input port; use it to
    find the hardware device (e.g. ``ctx->netdev_in->dpif_offload``).  Allocate
    a hardware CT entry and store a ``conn* -> hardware_handle`` mapping
    internally.  Return 0 on success or a positive ``errno`` on failure.

``conn_del(ctx)``
    Called when OVS removes a connection (expiry or flush).  ``ctx->netdev_in``
    is NULL; look up the hardware handle by ``ctx->conn``.  Remove the hardware
    CT entry and free internal state.

Optional callbacks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``conn_established(ctx)``
    Called exactly once when the first reply-direction packet is seen for an
    offloaded connection, while OVS holds ``conn->lock``.  ``ctx->netdev_in``
    is the reply-direction input port.  Update the hardware CT entry with the
    reply port so the hardware knows both directions.  Return ``true`` if the
    connection is now fully established in hardware; return ``false`` if
    hardware establishment failed or was deferred.

    If this callback is NULL, the framework skips the established transition
    and the provider never receives bidirectional port information.

``conn_update(ctx)``
    Called periodically by the conntrack idle timer to query hardware for a
    last-used timestamp.  ``ctx->netdev_in`` is NULL; look up by ``ctx->conn``.
    Return the last-used time in milliseconds since epoch, or 0 if the
    connection is not found or no timestamp is available.  A non-zero return
    value causes OVS to refresh the connection's expiry timer, keeping
    long-running hardware-accelerated connections alive.

    If this callback is NULL, OVS relies solely on its own software idle timer,
    which will expire connections even if hardware is actively forwarding them.
    Implementing ``conn_update`` is strongly recommended for any provider that
    accelerates established connections.

``batch_submit(batch)``
    Alternative to per-connection callbacks for providers that benefit from
    bulk programming (e.g. single DMA ring submission).  If non-NULL,
    ``batch_submit`` is called with the full batch before the framework falls
    back to individual callbacks for any remaining operations.  Providers that
    do not need batching should leave this NULL.

``init()``
    One-time provider initialization called during ``ct_offload_register()``.
    Return 0 on success or a positive ``errno`` to abort registration.  May be
    NULL if no initialization is required.

``flush()``
    Remove all offloaded connections from hardware.  Called when OVS flushes
    the entire conntrack table (e.g. ``dpctl/flush-conntrack``).  May be NULL.

Registration and Automatic Activation
--------------------------------------

CT offload providers are registered with ``ct_offload_register()`` and
identified by a ``name`` string.  The framework automatically activates a
built-in provider if a dpif offload class with a matching ``type`` field is
already registered.

The activation path is::

    ovs-vsctl set Open_vSwitch . other_config:hw-offload=true
        |
        v
    dpif_offload_set_global_cfg()
        |
        +-- dpif_offload_module_init()   [first call only]
        |     registers all base dpif_offload_class entries
        |     (including "dummy", "tc", "dpdk") in the class shash
        |
        +-- sets offload_global_enabled = true
        |
        +-- ct_offload_set_global_cfg()  [first call only]
              calls ct_offload_module_init()
                for each built-in ct_offload_class:
                  if dpif_offload_class_is_registered(class->name):
                      ct_offload_register(class)

The key invariant is: **a ct_offload_class is activated if and only if a
dpif_offload_class with the same type string is already registered**.  For a
new hardware provider, this means:

* Set ``dpif_offload_class.type = "myhw"``
* Set ``ct_offload_class.name = "myhw"``
* Add both to their respective ``base_*_classes[]`` arrays in
  ``lib/dpif-offload.c`` and ``lib/ct-offload.c``.

When ``hw-offload`` is enabled, the CT offload module will check
``dpif_offload_class_is_registered("myhw")``; if true, it calls
``ct_offload_register(&ct_offload_myhw_class)`` automatically.

Implementing a New Provider
----------------------------

This section walks through a minimum viable implementation.

Step 1: Define a hardware handle type and internal state
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The provider owns the ``conn* -> hardware_handle`` mapping.  A simple approach
uses a hash map or linked list protected by a mutex::

    struct myhw_ct_entry {
        struct hmap_node  hmap_node;  /* keyed by (uintptr_t)conn */
        const struct conn *conn;
        uint64_t          hw_handle;  /* opaque HW reference */
        struct netdev     *fwd_netdev;
        struct netdev     *rev_netdev;
    };

    static struct hmap    myhw_ct_table = HMAP_INITIALIZER(&myhw_ct_table);
    static struct ovs_mutex myhw_mutex  = OVS_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

Step 2: Implement conn_add
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    static int
    myhw_conn_add(const struct ct_offload_ctx *ctx)
    {
        /* Recover the dpif_offload instance from the netdev. */
        struct dpif_offload *offload = ctx->netdev_in->dpif_offload;
        if (!offload) {
            return ENODEV;
        }

        uint64_t hw_handle;
        int err = myhw_program_ct_entry(offload, ctx->conn, &hw_handle);
        if (err) {
            return err;
        }

        struct myhw_ct_entry *e = xmalloc(sizeof *e);
        e->conn       = ctx->conn;
        e->hw_handle  = hw_handle;
        e->fwd_netdev = ctx->netdev_in;
        e->rev_netdev = NULL;

        ovs_mutex_lock(&myhw_mutex);
        hmap_insert(&myhw_ct_table, &e->hmap_node, (uintptr_t) ctx->conn);
        ovs_mutex_unlock(&myhw_mutex);
        return 0;
    }

Step 3: Implement conn_established
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    static bool
    myhw_conn_established(const struct ct_offload_ctx *ctx)
    {
        ovs_mutex_lock(&myhw_mutex);
        struct myhw_ct_entry *e = myhw_find__(ctx->conn);
        bool ok = false;

        if (e && !e->rev_netdev) {
            struct dpif_offload *offload = ctx->netdev_in->dpif_offload;
            if (offload && !myhw_update_ct_entry_rev(offload, e->hw_handle,
                                                     ctx->netdev_in)) {
                e->rev_netdev = ctx->netdev_in;
                ok = true;
            }
        }
        ovs_mutex_unlock(&myhw_mutex);
        return ok;
    }

Step 4: Implement conn_update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    static long long
    myhw_conn_update(const struct ct_offload_ctx *ctx)
    {
        ovs_mutex_lock(&myhw_mutex);
        struct myhw_ct_entry *e = myhw_find__(ctx->conn);
        long long last_used = 0;

        if (e) {
            last_used = myhw_query_last_used(e->hw_handle);
        }
        ovs_mutex_unlock(&myhw_mutex);
        return last_used;  /* ms since epoch, or 0 */
    }

Step 5: Implement conn_del
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    static void
    myhw_conn_del(const struct ct_offload_ctx *ctx)
    {
        /* netdev_in is NULL here; look up by conn pointer. */
        ovs_mutex_lock(&myhw_mutex);
        struct myhw_ct_entry *e = myhw_find__(ctx->conn);

        if (e) {
            myhw_remove_ct_entry(e->hw_handle);
            hmap_remove(&myhw_ct_table, &e->hmap_node);
            free(e);
        }
        ovs_mutex_unlock(&myhw_mutex);
    }

Step 6: Declare the class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    const struct ct_offload_class ct_offload_myhw_class = {
        .name             = "myhw",   /* must match dpif_offload class type */
        .init             = NULL,
        .batch_submit     = NULL,
        .conn_add         = myhw_conn_add,
        .conn_del         = myhw_conn_del,
        .conn_update      = myhw_conn_update,
        .conn_established = myhw_conn_established,
        .can_offload      = myhw_can_offload,
        .flush            = myhw_flush,
    };

Step 7: Register in the built-in list
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In ``lib/ct-offload.c``, add the new class to ``base_ct_offload_classes[]``::

    static const struct ct_offload_class *base_ct_offload_classes[] = {
        &ct_offload_dummy_class,
        &ct_offload_myhw_class,   /* add here */
    };

And declare the extern in ``lib/ct-offload.h``::

    extern const struct ct_offload_class ct_offload_myhw_class;

Signaling Hardware Handling Back to the dpif-offload Layer
-----------------------------------------------------------

When a connection is fully accelerated in hardware, subsequent packets for
that connection should bypass software conntrack.  This bypass is achieved
through the **flow offloading layer**, not through a direct feedback signal in
the ct-offload API.

The mechanism works as follows:

1. The first packet for a new connection causes an upcall.  OVS processes the
   packet through software conntrack (``conn_add`` fires), then installs a
   **datapath flow** that matches all subsequent packets for this 5-tuple.

2. The dpif-offload layer (``dpif_offload_class``) can push this datapath flow
   to hardware.  Once installed in hardware, matching packets are forwarded
   directly, never reaching the upcall handler or software conntrack again.

3. The ct-offload layer is responsible only for keeping the hardware CT table
   in sync: ``conn_add`` programs hardware CT state, ``conn_established``
   updates the reverse direction, ``conn_update`` extends the software expiry
   based on hardware activity, and ``conn_del`` cleans up.

In this model the ct-offload provider does not need to signal anything back
to the dpif-offload layer.  The two layers operate independently on the same
netdev.  The provider's dpif-offload implementation handles flow-rule
installation; the ct-offload implementation handles CT-state synchronization.

However, if the hardware CT engine can generate expiry events or last-used
interrupts, the provider should surface those as return values from
``conn_update``.  A non-zero return from ``conn_update`` causes OVS to refresh
the software expiry timer, preventing the software side from expiring a
connection that hardware is still actively forwarding.

Minimum Viable Implementation
------------------------------

To get a working provider with no hardware acceleration (useful for testing
the integration path), implement only the three mandatory callbacks and accept
all connections::

    static bool  myhw_can_offload(const struct ct_offload_ctx *ctx)
    {
        return true;
    }
    static int   myhw_conn_add(const struct ct_offload_ctx *ctx)
    {
        return 0;
    }
    static void  myhw_conn_del(const struct ct_offload_ctx *ctx) { }

    const struct ct_offload_class ct_offload_myhw_class = {
        .name        = "myhw",
        .can_offload = myhw_can_offload,
        .conn_add    = myhw_conn_add,
        .conn_del    = myhw_conn_del,
    };

Without ``conn_update``, software idle timers will expire connections
regardless of hardware activity.  Without ``conn_established``, the provider
never learns the reply-direction port.  A production implementation should
provide both.

Configuration
-------------

Conntrack offloading is enabled as part of the global hardware offload
configuration::

    ovs-vsctl set Open_vSwitch . other_config:hw-offload=true

No additional configuration is required.  The CT offload framework activates
automatically when ``hw-offload`` is set and a matching dpif offload class is
registered.  To disable, set ``hw-offload=false`` and restart OVS (the
enable path is a one-shot ``ovsthread_once``).

Testing
-------

The ``ct_offload_dummy_class`` (``lib/ct-offload-dummy.c``) is a complete
software-only reference implementation.  It records every lifecycle event and
exposes inspection helpers (``ct_offload_dummy_n_added()``,
``ct_offload_dummy_is_bidirectional()``, etc.) that unit tests use to verify
callback delivery.

The dummy class is registered automatically when the dummy dpif offload class
is active (``hw-offload=true`` with a dummy datapath), making it possible to
exercise the full ct-offload path in the OVS test suite without any hardware.
The unit tests in ``tests/library.at`` cover each individual callback, and the
integration test in ``tests/dpif-netdev.at`` verifies the end-to-end path
including bidirectional ``netdev_in`` propagation.

New providers should follow the same test structure: unit tests that call
``ct_offload_register()`` directly (bypassing the dpif-offload gate), and an
integration test that enables ``hw-offload`` with the real hardware type and
verifies each lifecycle event fires with the correct context.
