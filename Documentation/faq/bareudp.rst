Q: What is Bareudp?

    A: There are various L3 encapsulation standards using UDP being discussed
       to leverage the UDP based load balancing capability of different
       networks. MPLSoUDP (__ https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7510) is one among
       them.

       The Bareudp tunnel provides a generic L3 encapsulation support for
       tunnelling different L3 protocols like MPLS, IP, NSH etc. inside a UDP
       tunnel.

       An example to create bareudp device to tunnel MPLS traffic is given
       below.::

           $ ovs-vsctl add-port br_mpls udp_port -- set interface udp_port \
             type=bareudp options:remote_ip=2.1.1.3 options:local_ip=2.1.1.2 \
             options:payload_type=0x8847 options:dst_port=6635 \
             options:packet_type="legacy_l3" \
             ofport_request=$bareudp_egress_port

       The bareudp device supports special handling for MPLS & IP as they can
       have multiple ethertypes.
       MPLS procotcol can have ethertypes ETH_P_MPLS_UC (unicast) &
       ETH_P_MPLS_MC (multicast). IP protocol can have ethertypes ETH_P_IP (v4)
       & ETH_P_IPV6 (v6).

       The bareudp device to tunnel L3 traffic with multiple ethertypes
       (MPLS & IP) can be created by passing the L3 protocol name as string in
       the field payload_type. An example to create bareudp device to tunnel
       MPLS unicast & multicast traffic is given below.::

           $ ovs-vsctl add-port  br_mpls udp_port -- set interface udp_port \
             type=bareudp options:remote_ip=2.1.1.3 options:local_ip=2.1.1.2 \
             options:payload_type=mpls options:dst_port=6635 \
             options:packet_type="legacy_l3"
