 *
 * Thread-safety
 * =============
 *
 * Except near the beginning or ending of its lifespan, rule 'rule' belongs to
 * its pmd thread's classifier.  The text below calls this classifier 'cls'.
 *
 * Motivation
 * ----------
 *
 * The thread safety rules described here for "struct dp_netdev_flow" are
 * motivated by two goals:
 *
 *    - Prevent threads that read members of "struct dp_netdev_flow" from
 *      reading bad data due to changes by some thread concurrently modifying
 *      those members.
 *
 *    - Prevent two threads making changes to members of a given "struct
 *      dp_netdev_flow" from interfering with each other.
 *
 *
 * Rules
 * -----
 *
 * A flow 'flow' may be accessed without a risk of being freed during an RCU
 * grace period.  Code that needs to hold onto a flow for a while
 * should try incrementing 'flow->ref_cnt' with dp_netdev_flow_ref().
 *
 * 'flow->ref_cnt' protects 'flow' from being freed.  It doesn't protect the
 * flow from being deleted from 'cls' and it doesn't protect members of 'flow'
 * from modification.
 *
 * Some members, marked 'const', are immutable.  Accessing other members
 * requires synchronization, as noted in more detail below.
