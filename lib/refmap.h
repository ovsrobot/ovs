/*
 * Reference map
 * =============
 *
 * This key-value store acts like a regular concurrent hashmap,
 * except that insertion takes a reference on the value if already
 * present.
 * The key provided must be fully initialized, including potential pad bytes.
 *
 * As the value creation is dependent on it being already present
 * within the structure and the user cannot predict that, this structure
 * requires definitions for value_init and value_uninit functions,
 * that will be called only at creation (first reference taken) and
 * destruction (last reference released).
 *
 * Example:
 * 1. struct key key;
 * 2. memset(&key, 0, sizeof key);
 * 3. refmap_create()
 * 4. value = refmap_ref(key);
 *    Since it's the first reference for <key>, value_init is called.
 * 5. refmap_ref(key);
 *    This is not the first reference for <key>.  Only ref-count is updated.
 * 6. refmap_unref(value);
 *    This is not the last reference released.  Only ref-count is updated.
 * 7. refmap_unref(value);
 *    This is the last reference released.  value_uninit is immediately
 *    called, while the value memory is freed after RCU grace period.
 *
 * Thread safety
 * =============
 *
 * MT-unsafe:
 *   * refmap_create
 *   * refmap_destroy
 *
 * MT-safe:
 *   * REFMAP_FOR_EACH
 *   * refmap_ref
 *   * refmap_try_ref
 *   * refmap_try_ref_value
 *   * refmap_unref
 *
 * Callback constraints
 * ====================
 *
 * value_init() and value_uninit() are invoked while holding the map's
 * internal mutex.  They must not call back into any refmap API on the
 * same map as that would deadlock.
 *
